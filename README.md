# Github Trending

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Server 
As there was CORS issue with the provided resources, I had to create a nodejs server for trending repositories and developers.

So, we should start server first:

From `server` folder:

Run `npm install` then `npm start`.

### Client

From `client` folder: 

Run `npm install` then `npm start`.
